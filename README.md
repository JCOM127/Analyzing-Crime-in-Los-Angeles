Project Title:** LA Crime Analysis and Visualization

Description:
This project utilizes Python's Pandas library to analyze and visualize crime data. Leveraging the Pandas framework, the code processes a dataset containing information about crimes, including dates, times, and victim demographics. It performs exploratory data analysis to uncover insights such as peak crime hours, crime occurrences over time, and crime frequency across various victim age groups.

Key Features:
- Crime data parsing and analysis using Pandas
- Identification of peak crime hours and night crime frequency
- Analysis of crimes committed against victims by age group
- Visualization of crime trends through histograms and bar plots

Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Purpose:
The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of Pandas and Python for analyzing crime datasets. By providing clear visualizations and insights into crime trends based on different factors, it helps in understanding patterns in criminal activities and their relationships with various demographic aspects.
